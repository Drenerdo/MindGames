### Changed
- API Reference/Comments: enhance data + fix typos.
- Core: ConnectedDeviceStatus prefab now displays "--" instead of 0 when the battery value has still not be received.
- Core: [BREAKING] refactor BLEEvent.BLEEventType to BLEEvent.Type.
- Demos: fix bug where selecting a new channel in NeuroTV unmute without hiding the icon. It now keeps the audio muted.
- Demos: fix bug where top-right menu was inaccessible at Platformer's start.
- Examples: videos switched to WebM format.
- Examples: bugfix in SDKDiscovery's last step where 2 objects could be cut at the same time.
- EventNotifier: better management of messages (stack messages).
- NeuroTag Gallery: refactor scene's objects names and enhance comments.
- NeuroTag Gallery: hide the triangle feedback when the stimulation is stopped.
- NeuroTags: fix bug where only the first material of a Stimulation Renderer's materials was used for the stimulation.
- NeuroTags: "Fix" button on NeuroTags is only display if ALL the materials of the renderer are not NextMind compatible.
- NeuroTags: update confidence values before invoking trigger/release events. Fixes confidence values being reset to 1 when a neurotag is disabled upon a trigger event.
- NeuroTags: fix bug where SetNeuroTagBehaviour called from Awake has no effect.
- Shaders: fix differences between SRP and Built-in shaders.
### Added 
- Core: display more explicit warnings (console and editor), mainly when there are too much NeuroTags in the scene.
- Core: new ContactGradeEvent and methods GetContactGrade() and GetNormalizedContactGrade().
- Editor: new Welcome panel displayed on SDK importation, asking the user if Unity should add the example scenes to build settings.
- Shaders: add Metallic and Glossiness properties to SRP Lit shaders.
- Calibration: CalibrationGrade enumeration has a new UNDEFINED value.
### Removed
- Calibration scene : remove unused SelectedDeviceStep.
- Core: [BREAKING] remove OTAEvent class.

## [1.5.0] - 2021-06-30

- Allow to declare multiple Tracking Cameras on NeuroManager
- Scriptable Render Pipeline assets (prefabs, materials, and example scenes variants) are available. See SRP folders and example folder's README file
- Warning messages displayed on shaders editors when their configuration is not optimal
- New error and warning messages (e.g. NextMindManager is not installed, bad bluetooth connection, ...)

- Bugfix : Simulation mode on Collider2D with perspective Camera
- Bugfix : shadergraphs triplanar projection was using world space normals instead of local space
- Bugfix : shadergraphs "Constant size" property was creating deformation artefacts on stimulation texture
- Use Gradient on ContactsVisualization instead of 2 colors
- Remove "Screen Ratio" property from Nextmind's shaders. This is now computed automatically
### Added 
- Contact Quality is now visible in the profiler, and accessible through script using Device.GetAverageContactQuality()
